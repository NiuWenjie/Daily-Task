The author says: staring at a screen doesn't damage your eyes. They won't make you go blind, and your doctor isn't going to worry about your health if he or she hears that you're spending a lot of time in front of them. However, you might feel uncomfortable after a long time in front of a backlight, and you might even experience the symptoms of Computer Vision Syndrome, a fancy name for the eye strain and discomfort monitors can cause.

You could attept to agjust your entire monitor and desk setup to remedy your pain, or you could use moistening eyedrops. The 20-20-20 rule also exists, which dictates that after 20 minutes of screen staring, you should stare at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Take a break. Those blue light-filtering glasses you bought could help,too, but doctors aren't totally convinced. Scientist just doesn't back up these glasses' claims. That said, you could still wear them and hope for the best. They aren't going to hurt you.
