  \title{Feeling about Martin Luther King：how a rebel leader was lost to history} 
\begin{document} 
  \maketitle 
    Fifty years after King’s death,the civil rights leader is a national treasure in the US. On 15 January 1998,James Farmer was awarded the presidential mental of freedom in the White House’s East Room.As Bill Clinton said, “And until today, I frankly think he’s never got the credit he deserves.His long overdue recognition has come to pass.”

    Farmer was blind,diabetic,and a double amputee in 1961.He died the following years.The weak man who has a robust soul ran the Congress of Racial Equality and led the Freedom Rides.After the ceremony , He said it was the best day of his life, as if the years of invisibility were over.But what upset him is that he was in the shadow of Martin Luther King.

	    Half a century after King’s assassination,there is value in reflecting on that shadow. This week,the US will indulge in an orgy of self-congratulation,selectively misrepresenting King’s life and work,as if rebelling against the American establishment was.

		In my opinion, leaders in any fields are able to be lost to history especially in nowadays when information and traffic explode.What is the key to avoid this occasion is keeping innovation ability and active in the front line.
