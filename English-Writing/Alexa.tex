\begin{document}
\maketitle
Amazon is introducing a new way to create Alexa skills today, without the need of coding or tech skills. Alexa Skill Blueprints will let the average household customize a variety of questions, with personal answers and responses that are separate to routines. The idea is to make it very easy for anyone create a skill or question/ answer that will only run on their Alexa devices. 

	What is very interesting is this could be a custom joke response to an Alexa question like “who’s the best dad in the world,” the ability for Alexa to provide a set of instruction for the pet sitter or babysitter, or predefined ‘burns” to roast your friends or father-in-law. 

	Alexa is becoming more personal with custom responses. The more practice you give it, the smarter Alexa is. Amazon is providing a set of templates to let anyone create these skills and custom questions / responses, which is designed for house guests especially.
